# Predicting-Response-to-Promotional-Campaign-

In this project, I apply Machine Learning algorithms to retail data that captures annual and monthly spending trends. The aim of this project is to strategically target customers with campaings based on their spending trends. Binary Classification Algorithms will be used and the steps of this projecy are:

1. Visualizing the data to gain insights and preparing it for algorithms
3. Training classification models and selecting the best model 
4. Fine-tuning the best model
5. Present solution (pptx)
6. Suggest ways to launch, monitor, and maintain system
